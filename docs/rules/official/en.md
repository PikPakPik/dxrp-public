  - A maximum of 2 fading doors can be used as doors per base (This includes any door used to reach valuables or any part of the base). <br>

  - Fading doors used for other purposes do not count towards that limit. These fading doors cannot be giving an unfair advantage. <br>
    -Other purposes can be an emergency exit (a door that can only be used from one direction), peep holes (fading door that can be toggled to shoot through), etc.
